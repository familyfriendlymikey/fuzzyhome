useful modifications:

cmd+option+b for bookmark manager
cmd+h for home instead of closing tab and opening new tab

This is the latest working preview of fuzzyhome which can be
found at https://preview.fuzzyhome.pages.dev/

I have big plans for fuzzyhome but don't have time to act on them
right now. As things stand it works really well and is a huge
productivity booster if you use it properly. I haven't
experienced any runtime errors using it dozens or hundreds of
times a day for months now, so it seems to be pretty stable.
Export your links just in case :)
